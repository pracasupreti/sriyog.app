                Analyzing the Global Service market, we found unbelievable
                facts:

                    Local experts have a tremendous market; as a result, they
                    drop the small works whereas starters never get an
                    opportunity to prove themselves.
                  </span>

                    The experts and veterans never work to build their team and
                    gain trust. To grab this opportunity, various agencies
                    filled in the space by creating the market and are
                    performing much smoothly.

                    But agencies are creating a hectic schedule, paying low to
                    their employees and charging much higher to the service
                    seekers.

                  Analyzing the global trend of migration, we can find the only
                  reason for skyrocketing foreign employment is that people

                  than creating something new by themselves.
